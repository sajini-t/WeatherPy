# WeatherPy
## Purpose: Extend the PlanMyTrip app by adding the weather description to the weather data we’ve already retrieved. 

### The PlanMyTrip app uses data from 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time and narrowed that to: 
#### - 1) hotels that were within a given range of latitude and longitude and that 
#### - (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.

#### Jack and his Beta testers love the app. As, with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to take it to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data we’ve already retrieved in this module. 

#### We will then have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

#### From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta testers will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 

#### Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
